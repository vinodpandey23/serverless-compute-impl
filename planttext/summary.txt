' Notes for clarity
note right of [User/Application]: External entity sending\nHTTP requests to the system
note left of [API Gateway Layer]: Handles request routing,\nauthentication, and logging
note right of [Compute Layer]: Executes general-purpose\nand AI/ML functions
note left of [Event Streaming Layer]: Manages asynchronous\nprocessing (e.g., batch ML inference)
note right of [AI/ML Layer]: Manages AI/ML workflows,\nincluding pipeline orchestration
note left of [CI/CD Layer]: Automates deployment\nof functions and artifacts
note right of [Storage Layer]: Manages caching, logging,\nand storage of system artifacts
note left of [Monitoring and Observability Layer]: Monitors metrics, logs,\nand traces across the system
